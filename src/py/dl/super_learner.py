This tutorial demonstrates how to classify structured data (e.g. tabular data in a CSV). We will use [Keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras) to define the model, and [feature columns](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/feature_columns) as a bridge to map from columns in a CSV to features used to train the model. This tutorial contains complete code to:

* Load a CSV file using [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/).
* Build an input pipeline to batch and shuffle the rows using [tf.data](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/datasets).
* Map from columns in the CSV to features used to train the model using feature columns.
* Build, train, and evaluate a model using Keras.

## The Dataset

We will use a small [dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/heart+Disease) provided by the Cleveland Clinic Foundation for Heart Disease. There are several hundred rows in the CSV. Each row describes   a patient, and each column describes an attribute. We will use this information to predict whether a patient has heart disease, which in this dataset is a binary classification task.

Following is a [description](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/heart-disease/heart-disease.names) of this dataset. Notice there are both numeric and categorical columns.

>Column| Description| Feature Type | Data Type
>------------|--------------------|----------------------|-----------------
>Age | Age in years | Numerical | integer
>Sex | (1 = male; 0 = female) | Categorical | integer
>CP | Chest pain type (0, 1, 2, 3, 4) | Categorical | integer
>Trestbpd | Resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital) | Numerical | integer
>Chol | Serum cholestoral in mg/dl | Numerical | integer
>FBS | (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false) | Categorical | integer
>RestECG | Resting electrocardiographic results (0, 1, 2) | Categorical | integer
>Thalach | Maximum heart rate achieved | Numerical | integer
>Exang | Exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no) | Categorical | integer
>Oldpeak | ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest | Numerical | float
>Slope | The slope of the peak exercise ST segment | Numerical | integer
>CA | Number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy | Numerical | integer
>Thal | 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect | Categorical | string
>Target | Diagnosis of heart disease (1 = true; 0 = false) | Classification | integer

# ### Bucketized columns
# Often, you don't want to feed a number directly into the model, but instead split its value into different categories based on numerical ranges. Consider raw data that represents a person's age. Instead of representing age as a numeric column, we could split the age into several buckets using a [bucketized column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/bucketized_column). Notice the one-hot values below describe which age range each row matches.

# """### Categorical columns
# In this dataset, thal is represented as a string (e.g. 'fixed', 'normal', or 'reversible'). We cannot feed strings directly to a model. Instead, we must first map them to numeric values. The categorical vocabulary columns provide a way to represent strings as a one-hot vector (much like you have seen above with age buckets). The vocabulary can be passed as a list using [categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_list), or loaded from a file using [categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_vocabulary_file).

"""In a more complex dataset, many columns would be categorical (e.g. strings). Feature columns are most valuable when working with categorical data. Although there is only one categorical column in this dataset, we will use it to demonstrate several important types of feature columns that you could use when working with other datasets.

### Embedding columns
Suppose instead of having just a few possible strings, we have thousands (or more) values per category. For a number of reasons, as the number of categories grow large, it becomes infeasible to train a neural network using one-hot encodings. We can use an embedding column to overcome this limitation. Instead of representing the data as a one-hot vector of many dimensions, an [embedding column](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/embedding_column) represents that data as a lower-dimensional, dense vector in which each cell can contain any number, not just 0 or 1. The size of the embedding (8, in the example below) is a parameter that must be tuned.

Key point: using an embedding column is best when a categorical column has many possible values. We are using one here for demonstration purposes, so you have a complete example you can modify for a different dataset in the future.
"""

# Notice the input to the embedding column is the categorical column
# we previously created
# thal_embedding = feature_column.embedding_column(thal, dimension=8)
# demo(thal_embedding)

"""### Hashed feature columns

Another way to represent a categorical column with a large number of values is to use a [categorical_column_with_hash_bucket](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/feature_column/categorical_column_with_hash_bucket). This feature column calculates a hash value of the input, then selects one of the `hash_bucket_size` buckets to encode a string. When using this column, you do not need to provide the vocabulary, and you can choose to make the number of hash_buckets significantly smaller than the number of actual categories to save space.

Key point: An important downside of this technique is that there may be collisions in which different strings are mapped to the same bucket. In practice, this can work well for some datasets regardless.
"""

# thal_hashed = feature_column.categorical_column_with_hash_bucket(
#       'thal', hash_bucket_size=1000)
# demo(feature_column.indicator_column(thal_hashed))

"""### Crossed feature columns
Combining features into a single feature, better known as [feature crosses](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/glossary/#feature_cross), enables a model to learn separate weights for each combination of features. Here, we will create a new feature that is the cross of age and thal. Note that `crossed_column` does not build the full table of all possible combinations (which could be very large). Instead, it is backed by a `hashed_column`, so you can choose how large the table is.
"""

# crossed_feature = feature_column.crossed_column([age_buckets, thal], hash_bucket_size=1000)
# demo(feature_column.indicator_column(crossed_feature))

"""## Choose which columns to use
We have seen how to use several types of feature columns. Now we will use them to train a model. The goal of this tutorial is to show you the complete code (e.g. mechanics) needed to work with feature columns. We have selected a few columns to train our model below arbitrarily.

Key point: If your aim is to build an accurate model, try a larger dataset of your own, and think carefully about which features are the most meaningful to include, and how they should be represented.
